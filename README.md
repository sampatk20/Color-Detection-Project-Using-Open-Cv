# Color-Detection-Project-Using-Open-Cv

This my Color Detection Project using OpenCv. Basically,Colour detection is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps.
Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. But for our human eyes its completely an easy process to recognise the colors, but for computers its not a straight forward process
and so the project explains how the color detection works.
I have attached my source code for reference of my project.
Do check it out!
